# Food Delivery Platform Plan

## 1. Project Setup & Requirements Analysis

- Define detailed requirements for each microservice.
- Create user stories and acceptance criteria for each role:
    - Customer
    - Restaurant Admin
    - Delivery Personnel

## 2. Architecture Design

- Design a high-level microservices architecture diagram, including:
    - **User Authentication Service**
    - **Restaurant Management Service**
    - **Order Processing Service**
    - **Payment Service**
    - **Notification Service**
    - **Delivery Tracking Service**
- Plan API endpoints for each service.
- Design the database schema for each service.

## 3. Technology Stack Selection

- **Backend**: Spring Boot (Java)
- **Frontend**: React vite (tailwind) for the asynchronous web client.
- **Database**: SQL (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 or JWT for secure access.
- **Containerization**: Docker.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for microservices management.
- **Messaging**: Kafka for asynchronous communication.

## 4. Core Microservices Implementation

### User Service
- User registration, authentication, and authorization.
- Role-based access control.

### Restaurant Service
- Restaurant profile management.
- Menu management.
- Inventory tracking.

### Order Service
- Order creation and processing.
- Order status tracking.

### Payment Service
- Integration with payment gateways.
- Transaction management.

### Notification Service
- Email notifications using services like SendGrid.
- SMS notifications using services like Twilio.

### Delivery Service
- Assignment of delivery personnel.
- Delivery tracking.
- ETA calculation.

## 5. Frontend Development

- Develop role-specific interfaces:
    - Customer portal.
    - Restaurant admin dashboard.
    - Delivery personnel mobile interface.

## 6. Testing & Integration

- Write unit tests for each microservice.
- Perform integration testing.
- Conduct end-to-end testing.

## 7. Deployment & Documentation

- Create Docker containers for each service.
- Set up Kubernetes deployment configuration.
- Prepare comprehensive documentation.
- Create deployment instructions.

## 8. Prepare Deliverables

- Organize code according to the required structure.
- Record a demonstration video.
- Write the project report.
- Prepare all required text files.

## Repository Organization

### Monorepo Approach

A single repository with multiple directories for each microservice:

```
food-delivery-platform/
├── services/
│   ├── user-service/
│   ├── restaurant-service/
│   ├── order-service/
│   ├── payment-service/
│   ├── notification-service/
│   └── delivery-service/
│   └── gateway/
├── frontend/
│   ├── rolebased-frontend/
├── kubernetes/
│   ├── deployments/
│   ├── services/
│   └── configs/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── README.md
└── docs/
```

## Microservices Architecture Explanation

### Frontend Layer
- Three separate interfaces for different user roles.
- Communicates with backend services through the API Gateway.

### API Gateway
- Single entry point for all client requests.
- Handles routing, load balancing, and authentication.
- Improves security by hiding the internal service structure.

### Microservices Layer
- **User Service**: Handles user registration, authentication, and role management.
- **Restaurant Service**: Manages restaurant profiles, menus, and availability.
- **Order Service**: Processes orders and tracks their status.
- **Delivery Service**: Assigns and tracks delivery personnel.
- **Payment Service**: Handles payment processing and history.
- **Notification Service**: Sends emails and SMS to users.
- **Analytics Service**: Provides reporting and insights (optional).

### Message Broker
- Facilitates asynchronous communication between services.
- Ensures reliability in inter-service communication.
- Enables event-driven architecture (e.g., order status changes trigger notifications).

### Database Layer
- Each service can have its own database (polyglot persistence).
- Ensures loose coupling between services.

## Implementation Approach

1. Define service interfaces and API contracts first.
2. Implement core services one by one:
     - User → Restaurant → Order → Payment → Notification → Delivery - gateway
3. Use Docker Compose for local development and testing. (generate files but do not run on local machine)
4. Set up Kubernetes deployment configurations for production-ready deployment.(generate files but do not run on local machine)
5. Use a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
6. Use Swagger for API documentation.

## Frontend Implementation Requirements

### Core User Flow
1. **User Authentication Flow**
   - User registration with role selection
   - Login with JWT token management
   - Password recovery
   - Profile management

2. **Customer Journey**
   - Landing page with featured restaurants and categories
   - Restaurant browsing with filtering and search
   - Restaurant details view with menu items
   - Cart management
   - Checkout process
   - Order tracking
   - Order history
   - User profile management

3. **Restaurant Admin Journey**
   - Restaurant profile management
   - Menu management (add, edit, delete items)
   - Order management
   - Business analytics dashboard

4. **Delivery Personnel Journey**
   - Available orders list
   - Order acceptance
   - Delivery status updates
   - Delivery history
   - Earnings tracking

### Technical Requirements
1. **State Management**
   - Redux with Redux Toolkit for global state
   - Implement proper slices for each domain (auth, restaurants, orders, etc.)
   - Async thunks for API communication

2. **API Integration**
   - Axios for API requests
   - Request/response interceptors for auth and error handling
   - Service modules for each microservice endpoint

3. **UI/UX Requirements**
   - Responsive design for all device sizes
   - Consistent branding and theme
   - Accessible components
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Form validation

4. **Performance Considerations**
   - Lazy loading of routes
   - Optimized image loading
   - Minimizing unnecessary re-renders
   - Proper data caching strategies

5. **Deployment & CI/CD**
   - Build configuration for different environments
   - Docker containerization
   - Automated testing in CI pipeline
